* Descriptions

** Terminology

*** Aggressor orders

Because a incoming bid has to be matched against existing offers and
an incoming offer has to be matched against existing bids, we use the
term: aggressor order for the incoming bid (or offer).

Multiple aggressor orders can be incoming in one batch.


** Algorithms

*** Pro-rata



Price, quantity, time 

*** LMM Lead Market Maker

Some parties are given a priority and a fulfilment percentage - how of
an order may be filled by priority.

After the LMM allocation is made, then FIFO is used.

*** FIFO

Time-based: first in, first out

e-mini S&P 500 futures
Brent Oil futures
Cocoa futures

Resting quotes are those remaining, they now lose some time priority.

All orders at the same price level are filled according to time
priority; the first order at a price level is the first order matched.

By policy1, we choose to satisfy the highest bids first.
Note: the alternative is to process earliest (oldest) bids

By policy2, we choose to satisfy the lowest offer bids first.
Note: the alternative is to process earliest (oldest) bids

Find the highest bid (policy1)
find all the offers at or below.
allocate those offers, so that the lowest priced offers are allocated first (policy2)

For each fully allocated offer, issue a fill
For each fully allocated bid, issue a fill

For each partly allocated bid, issue a partial-fill
For each partly allocated offer, issue a partial-fill
