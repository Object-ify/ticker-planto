** Terminology

*** Aggressor orders

Because a incoming bid has to be matched against existing offers and
an incoming offer has to be matched against existing bids, we use the
term: aggressor order for the incoming bid (or offer).

Multiple aggressor orders can be incoming in one batch.

A bid or an ask can then be called an order.

A set of orders that satisfy an aggressor order is called the
satisfying orders.

The resting quantity is the amount remaining in the satisfying orders.

These satisfying orders are ranked by some prioritization mechanism
and then allocated to the aggressor order.

The aggressor order may be partially-filled. The satisfying orders may
be partially-filled. The portion that is allocated is known as a lot
aand are formally the lots of the aggressor and satisfying orders.

The satisfying orders that are not allocated, or any part thereof, are
then known as the unallocated satisfying orders - or the unallocated
orders or unallocated lots.

These then form a new, reduced, resting quantity known as the new
resting quantity. These remainders are then known as the resting
orders.

** Matching Algorithms

*** FIFO

Time-based: first in, first out

e-mini S&P 500 futures
Brent Oil and Cocoa futures

The aggressor order is used to form the satisfying set.

These are then ranked against time; the most recent is then allocated
first to the full amount.

Note: the new resting orders will increase in time-priority when new
orders arrive.

*** Pro-rata methods

Price, quantity, time and priority can all be used.

Essentially, a percentage is taken from each.

**** Pro-rata

e-mini JPY/USD futures, NZD/USD and AUD/USD futures

Find the satisfying orders. No need to rank them. Find the percentage
each takes of the total and allocate that proportion as a lot against the
aggressor order, rounding down the lot size where necessary.

This can lead to very small quantities in the partially-fulfilled
unallocated lots, so 

it can be decided that should any satisfying order fall below 2 lots,
it is not allocated and becomes a single lot.

Because of this, an aggressor order may not be fulfilled. If there is
a resting quantity, that is then allocated FIFO.

In this way, the single lots should eventually be allocated.

*** Pro-rata with Top Order

This operates in the same way as Pro-rata, but has a preliminary
prioritization of the satisfying orders, so that one of them is
designated the Top Order and it will always be fulfilled.

After the first Top Order is allocated, the pro-rata mechanism is
applied to the remaining satisfying orders.

Should there be any unallocated amount remaining after this, then a
new Top Order is designated and the process begins again.

*** LMM Lead Market Maker

Some parties are given a priority and a fulfilment percentage - how of
an order may be filled by priority.

After the LMM allocation is made, then a FIFO one carried out.

*** Split FIFO and Pro-Rata

Corn futures

A FIFO is applied first to a pre-defined percentage of the aggressor
order's quantity.

After that, a Pro-Rata mechanism is used, any lots smaller than one
are rounded down to zero. 

A levelling FIFO allocation may be performed afterwards. A new resting
quantity is calculated from the orders of those parties that did not
qualify for Pro-Rata, ie. those less than zero.

These are then allocated Pro-Rata against the remainder of the
aggressor order.

**** Variants: Top-Order and LMM

This can extend the algorithm.

*** Threshold Pro-Rata

Corn options

A Top-Order is allocated to a threshold percentage and a resting order must
meet the minimum level.

**** Threshold Pro-Rata with LMM

10y US Treasury Note Option

The Top-Order has priority over any LMM. After that, a Pro-Rata method
is used on any unallocated quantity in the aggressor order against the
new resting quantity.

*** Allocation

Eurodollar futures
EuroYen TIBOR futures
3y Eurodollar Bundle futures

Top-Order percentage
Pro-Rata, 2 lot minimum
FIFO any remaining

** Trade Algorithms

As a result of matching, a single aggressor order may produce multiple
trades, subsequent cancellation or updates of orders.

A single trade is posted for each aggressor order. A single update or
cancellation is posted for each allocated order.
